Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. The ultimate goal of NLP is to enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is both meaningful and useful. NLP techniques are used in various applications such as language translation, sentiment analysis, speech recognition, and chatbots. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and linguistic rules, NLP systems can process and analyze large amounts of natural language data, making it possible to automate and enhance many tasks that involve human language.
